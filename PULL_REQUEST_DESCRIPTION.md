# 🚀 Pull Request: Unified Interface + Internet Relay Implementation

## 📋 Summary
This PR implements the two main requirements requested:
1. **Internet Relay Server** - Deploy relay on cloud (not localhost)
2. **Unified Home Page** - Merge sender and receiver in one interface

## ✨ What's New

### 🌐 Internet Relay Server
- **New File**: `deploy-relay.js` - Production-ready P2P relay server
- **Cloud Deployment**: Ready for Railway, Render, Heroku, Docker
- **Health Monitoring**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring
- **Auto-scaling**: Environment-based configuration
- **Architecture**: A peer → Cloud Relay → B peer ✅

### 🏠 Unified Interface
- **New File**: `home.html` - Combined sender/receiver page
- **New File**: `home.js` - Unified JavaScript logic
- **Professional UI**: Modern design with Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time Status**: Live connection and peer monitoring
- **Quality Control**: Adjustable audio bitrate (32k-128k)

### 🚀 Deployment Ready
- **Railway**: `railway.toml` - One-click deployment
- **Docker**: `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`
- **Vercel**: `vercel.json` configuration
- **Scripts**: Automated deployment scripts

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Internet Relay Server
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Health checks, error handling, logging
- ✅ **Multi-Platform**: Railway, Render, Heroku, Docker support
- ✅ **Auto-Discovery**: Dynamic relay address via GitHub Gist
- ✅ **Scalable**: Environment-based configuration
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Health endpoint with connection metrics

### Unified Interface
- ✅ **Single Page**: Both streaming and receiving in one interface
- ✅ **Real-time Status**: Live peer count and connection status
- ✅ **Professional UI**: Modern design with status indicators
- ✅ **Audio Controls**: Quality selection, volume control
- ✅ **Debug Tools**: Built-in logging and diagnostics

### Developer Experience
- ✅ **One-Click Deploy**: Automated deployment scripts
- ✅ **Comprehensive Docs**: Step-by-step guides
- ✅ **Error-Free Code**: All diagnostics pass
- ✅ **Production Build**: Optimized for deployment

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing ✅
- [x] Health endpoint responds: `http://localhost:3001/health`
- [x] Unified interface works: `http://localhost:5173/home.html`
- [x] Audio streaming functional between tabs
- [x] No build errors or diagnostics issues

### Deployment Testing ✅
- [x] Railway configuration validated
- [x] Docker build successful

```bash
# Automated deployment
node deploy-to-railway.js
```

### Manual Deploy
```bash
# 1. Go to https://railway.app
# 2. Deploy from GitHub repo
# 3. Railway auto-deploys using railway.toml
```

## 📊 Before/After Comparison

### Before
