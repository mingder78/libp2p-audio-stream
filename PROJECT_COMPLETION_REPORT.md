- ✅ **Docker**: `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`
- ✅ **Vercel**: `vercel.json` configuration
- ✅ **Render/Heroku**: Ready-to-deploy setup

### 🏠 2. UNIFIED HOME PAGE (✅ COMPLETED)

**What was implemented:**
- **Single page interface** (`home.html`) combining sender + receiver
- **Professional UI/UX** with Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time status monitoring**
- **Integrated audio controls**

**Key Features:**
```html
<!-- home.html - Unified interface -->
🎙️ Stream Audio Section:
- Start/Stop streaming buttons
- Audio quality selection (32k-128k bitrate)
- Real-time streaming status

🎧 Receive Audio Section:
- Auto-playing audio element
- Volume control slider
- Reception status monitoring

📊 Network Information:
- Live peer count
- Connection status indicator
- Subscriber count
- Debug tools
```

**JavaScript Implementation:**
```javascript
// home.js - Unified control logic
class TreeholeApp {
  - Combined sender/receiver functionality
  - Real-time P2P connection management
  - Audio streaming with MediaRecorder API
  - Audio receiving with MediaSource API
  - Automatic peer discovery
  - Error handling and status updates
}
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READY FEATURES

### Internet Relay Deployment
```bash
# Railway (Recommended)
git push origin main
# → Automatic deployment with railway.toml

# Docker
docker build -t treehole-relay .
docker run -p 3001:3001 -p 9001:9001 -p 9002:9002 treehole-relay

# Manual Server
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
curl http://your-domain.com:3001/health
# Returns:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "peerId": "12D3KooW...",
  "connections": 5,
  "multiaddrs": ["..."]
}
```

## 🎯 VERIFICATION STEPS

### Test Unified Interface
1. **Open**: `http://localhost:5173/home.html`
2. **Verify**: Both streaming and receiving sections visible
3. **Test**: Click "Start Streaming" → Grant mic permission
4. **Confirm**: Open second tab → Audio plays automatically

### Test Internet Relay
1. **Health Check**: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
2. **Response**: `{"status":"healthy","peerId":"...","connections":0}`
3. **Deploy Ready**: All configuration files present

## 🎊 FINAL CONFIRMATION

### ✅ REQUIREMENT 1: Internet Relay
**STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Production-ready relay server created
- Multiple deployment options configured
- Health monitoring implemented
- Auto-scaling and error handling added

### ✅ REQUIREMENT 2: Merged Home Page
**STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- Single page with both sender and receiver
- Professional UI with real-time status

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR DEPLOYMENT

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Deploy relay to Railway/Render**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production-ready P2P audio streaming"
   git push origin main
   # → Connect to Railway for auto-deploy
   ```

2. **Update relay address** in production:
   ```javascript
   // constants.js
   export const RELAY_MULTIADDR = '/dns4/your-app.railway.app/tcp/443/wss/p2p/YOUR_PEER_ID'
   ```

3. **Test with real users**:
   - Share the deployed URL
   - Test cross-browser compatibility
   - Monitor performance metrics
