## 🚀 DEPLOY NOW

### Fastest Method (Railway):
```bash
# Automated deployment
node deploy-to-railway.js
```

### Manual Method:
```bash
# 1. Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy relay to internet"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to https://railway.app
# 3. Deploy from GitHub repo
# 4. Railway auto-deploys using railway.toml
```

---

## 🔍 Expected Results

### After Deployment:
1. **Health Endpoint**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
   ```json
   {
     "status": "healthy",
     "peerId": "12D3KooW...",
     "connections": 0,
     "multiaddrs": [
       "/dns4/your-app.railway.app/tcp/443/wss/p2p/12D3KooW..."
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Relay Address**: Copy the WSS multiaddr from health response

3. **Update Client**: Replace in `constants.js`:
   ```javascript
   export const RELAY_MULTIADDR = '/dns4/your-app.railway.app/tcp/443/wss/p2p/YOUR_PEER_ID'
   ```

---

## 🧪 Testing Procedure

### 1. Test Relay Health
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
# Should return 200 OK with healthy status
```

### 2. Test P2P Connection
1. Update `constants.js` with cloud relay address
2. Open `http://localhost:5173/home.html`
3. Verify "Connected to P2P network" status
4. Check peer count > 0

### 3. Test Audio Streaming
1. Open two browser tabs
2. Start streaming in tab 1
3. Verify audio plays in tab 2
4. Check relay logs for activity

## 📊 Current Local Status

### ✅ Services Running:
- **Local Relay**: `http://localhost:3001/health` (HEALTHY)
- **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:5173/home.html` (ACTIVE)
- **WebSocket Server**: `ws://localhost:3000` (CONNECTED)

### ✅ Code Status:
- **No errors**: All diagnostics pass
- **Build ready**: Production build successful
- **Tests pass**: Health checks working

## 🎉 READY TO DEPLOY

**Your relay peer is ready for internet deployment!**

The architecture **A peer → Cloud Relay Peer → B peer** will be fully functional once deployed.

### Next Action:
```bash
# Deploy now with one command:
node deploy-to-railway.js
```

**After deployment, you'll have a professional P2P relay running on the internet!** 🌍
